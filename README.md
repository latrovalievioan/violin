# Violin Practice
## Description
Well, I'm not only a programmer, but also a violinist.
I've decided to version control my practice routines, because I prefer markdown than note-taking apps.
If you have any questions about music theory, violin, jazz, etc - you can always hit me up, and I'll try to help you.
